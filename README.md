# producerCRM
producerCRM is a mobile app for keeping track of customer contact.

## Platforms
Currently, producerCRM is only targeting iOS, and specifically only iPad 2+ devices. 

## Technology
The producerCRM app is written in C#. Native iOS code is provided by the Xamarin Studio IDE. See also MonoTouch and Xcode.

## Enhancements
The app currently will run on iPhones (4S or higher), however the layout of the Views frequently cuts off controls rendering the UI useless. 
Addressing this issue may invlove substantial changes to the View architecture.

Assuming the changes necessary to run the app on an iPhone are completed, it should be straight-forward to port the app to Android. 
Likewise, porting to Windows phones and tablets should also be possible via the Xamarin architecture.
