In order to properly test code changes, both the code in Visual Studio and on the simulator must be refreshed.

If Project A depends on Project B, 
  * Project B must be rebuilt,
  * then Project A must be rebuilt,
  * then the Solution must be rebuilt.

For this Solution, 
  * CallForm.iOS depends on CallForm.Core (CallForm.iOS also depends on Cirrious.FluentLayouts.Touch and XibFree -- but they don't change).
  * BackEnd depends on CallForm.Core

The safest course is that if there has been a code change, complete the following steps:
  * clean the Solution
  * rebuild CallForm.Core
  * rebuild CallForm.iOS
  * rebuild the Solution.
  * on the Mac, reset the iOS Simulator
  * in Visual Studio start debugging on the iOS Simulator
