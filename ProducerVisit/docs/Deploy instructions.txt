Visual Studio

Update Web Service in code:
Manually update (search/replace) all references to the web service OUTSIDE OF the BackEnd project:
    CallForm.Core\Services\SemiStaticWebDataService.cs
    CallForm.Core\Services\UserIdentityService.cs
    CallForm.Core\ViewModels\ViewReports_ViewModel.cs
    CallForm.iOS\AppDelegate.cs (maybe)
    CallForm.iOS\Main.cs (maybe)
    CallForm.iOS\Reachability.cs (maybe)

For the BackEnd project, the web service is specified in the .pubxml file. 
HOWEVER, DO NOT manually update BackEnd\Properties\PublishProfiles\*.pubxml.
This is better handled by selecting the correct publishing profile and storing any changes there when publishing BackEnd.
    
Publish BackEnd Web Service (and database):
 1. Comment out line in BackEnd\Global.asax
 2. Rebuild BackEnd
 3. Rebuild Solution
 4. Publish BackEnd (web service)
    a. Build / Publish BackEnd
	b. On the Profile tab, select an appropriate profile
	c. On the Connection tab, 
		- select "Web Deploy" as the Publish Method
		- review all settings
		- Click the "Test Connection" 
	d. On the Settings tab, select "Release - Any CPU" as the Configuration
		- This selection determines the target database. See note in Web.Debug.Config for details. 
	e. Click Publish  
		- Browser opens and displays default page with no errors (see \docs\no errors.png)
 		- Tables created / exist on target database (as set in Web.*.config)
 5. Uncomment line in BackEnd Global.asax
 6. Rebuild BackEnd
 7. Rebuild CallForm.Core
 8. select 'iPhone' on the Solutions Platforms pull-down
 9. select a device on the Target iOS Device pull-down
10. Deploy CallForm.iOS (not Deploy Solution)

Mac
 1. Open Terminal window
 2. enter "cd" (should be in the home aka ~ directory)" 
 3. run ./CallForm-resign.sh
 4. copy .ipa from /IPA to /Public
 5. Check plist in .ipa for correct bundle ID

The bundle Id set in the CallForm.iOS Project properties must match the Id set in the "resign.sh" script.dave.nouza	wasabi84
