Visual Studio

Update Web Service in code:
Manually update (search/replace) all references to the web service OUTSIDE OF the BackEnd project:
    CallForm.Core\Services\SemiStaticWebDataService.cs
    CallForm.Core\Services\UserIdentityService.cs
    CallForm.Core\ViewModels\ViewReports_ViewModel.cs
    CallForm.iOS\AppDelegate.cs (maybe)
    CallForm.iOS\Main.cs (maybe)
    CallForm.iOS\Reachability.cs (maybe)

For the BackEnd project, the web service is specified in the .pubxml file. 
HOWEVER, DO NOT manually update BackEnd\Properties\PublishProfiles\*.pubxml.
This is better handled by selecting the correct publishing profile and storing any changes there when publishing BackEnd.
    
Publish BackEnd Web Service (and database):
1. Comment out line in BackEnd\Global.asax
2. Rebuild CallForm.Core
3. Rebuild Solution
4. Publish BackEnd (web service)
    a. Build / Publish BackEnd
	b. On the Profile tab, select an appropriate profile
	c. On the Connection tab, 
		- select "Web Deploy" as the Publish Method
		- review all settings
		- Click the "Test Connection" 
	d. On the Settings tab, select "Release - Any CPU" as the Configuration
		- see note in Web.Debug.Config for details. This selection relates to the target database.
	e. Click Publish 
		- Browser opens and displays default page with no errors (see \docs\no errors.png)
		- Tables created / exist on target database (as set in Web.*.config)
5. Uncomment line in BackEnd Global.asax
6. Rebuild CallForm.Core
7. Deploy CallForm.iOS (not Deploy Solution)
