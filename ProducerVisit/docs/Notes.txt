?? Operator
"??" is the null-coalescing operator. It returns the left-hand operand if the operand is not null; otherwise it returns the right hand operand.

  // Set y to the value of x if x is NOT null; otherwise, 
  // if x = null, set y to -1. 
  int y = x ?? -1;

?: Operator
The conditional operator (?:) returns one of two values depending on the value of a Boolean expression. Following is the syntax for the conditional operator.

  condition ? first_expression : second_expression;
