{"name":"Producercrm","tagline":"Manages Field Staff calls to members.","body":"# producerCRM\r\nproducerCRM is a mobile app for logging staff contact with customers.\r\n\r\n## Platforms\r\nCurrently, producerCRM is only targeting iOS, and specifically only iPad 2+ devices. \r\n\r\n## Technology\r\nThe producerCRM app is written in C#. Native iOS code is provided by the Xamarin Studio IDE. \r\n\r\n_See also: **MonoTouch**; **Xcode**._\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n### Functionality\r\n* differentiate manager and regular users\r\n* office\r\n    * reports\r\n    * ability to edit entries\r\n\r\n### Platforms\r\n#### Browser\r\nThe app accesses with the backend database via a web service. The functionality provided by the app (create an entry; search existing entries) needs to also be available to staff working from a desk. This will require an additional View (M **V** VM).\r\n\r\n#### iPhone\r\nThe app Views are currently designed/intended to be used only with iPads. It will run on iPhones (4S or higher), however the layout of the Views frequently cuts off controls rendering the UI useless. _Addressing this issue may invlove substantial changes to the View architecture._ One possible solution is to refactor the Views to use **Xamarin.Forms**.\r\n\r\n#### Android / Windows devices\r\nAssuming the changes necessary to run the app on an iPhone are completed, it should be straight-forward to port the app to Android. Likewise, porting to Windows phones and tablets should also be possible via the Xamarin architecture.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2013 Dave (@dfa-daven aka @phearce) began work on producerCRM. In late 2014 Ian (@IanLeatherbury) of Xamarin helped troubleshot some issues.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nCurrently there's no formal documentation. Contact @DFA-Daven and Iâ€™ll try to help you sort it out.","google":"UA-19650279-21","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
